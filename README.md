Of course. Here is a comprehensive README.md file for the project. You can save this file as README.md in the root directory of your project.

MERN Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Mini-Project

This is a minimal MERN stack application demonstrating end-to-end Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It includes a JWT-based authentication system, protected routes on both the client and server, and UI elements that render conditionally based on user permissions.

Goal

Build a minimal MERN app with login + role-based page access and one write-gated action to prove RBAC works end-to-end.

Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

Frontend: React (with Vite), React Router

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) stored in httpOnly cookies

Security: bcrypt for password hashing

Other: CORS, dotenv

Features

Secure user authentication (Login/Logout).

Role-based access for API endpoints (/api/reports).

Role-based access for client-side pages (/dashboard, /reports).

Dynamically rendered navigation menu based on user read permissions.

Conditionally rendered UI elements (e.g., "Create Report" button) based on user write permissions.

A database seed script for easy setup with predefined roles and users.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

MongoDB (must be installed and running on your local machine, or have a valid connection URI)

Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up.

1. Clone the Repository
code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
2. Backend Server Setup

Navigate to the server directory and install the required dependencies.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
cd server
npm install

Create a .env file in the /server directory and add the following environment variables.

server/.env
code
Env
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/rbac_test

# A long, random, and secret string for signing JWTs
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_that_is_long_and_random
3. Frontend Client Setup

Navigate to the client directory and install the required dependencies.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
cd ../client
npm install

Create a .env.local file in the /client directory and add the following variable.

client/.env.local
code
Env
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# The base URL for your backend API
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
4. Seed the Database

This is a crucial one-time step that creates the necessary roles, permissions, and user accounts.

Ensure your MongoDB server is running. Then, from the /server directory, run the seed script:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
cd ../server
npm run seed

You should see a success message in the console indicating that the database has been seeded.

Running the Application

You will need two separate terminals to run the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

1. Start the Backend Server:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# In your first terminal, from the /server directory
npm start

The server will be running on http://localhost:5000.

2. Start the Frontend Client:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# In your second terminal, from the /client directory
npm run dev

The client application will be available at http://localhost:5173.

Testing & User Credentials

You can test the application by logging in with the pre-seeded user accounts.

Password for all users: Pass@123

Role	Email	Password	Expected Behavior
Admin	alice.admin@example.com	Pass@123	Can see and access Dashboard & Reports. The "Create Report" button is visible and functional.
Manager	mark.manager@example.com	Pass@123	Can see and access Dashboard & Reports. The "Create Report" button is visible and functional.
Viewer	vicki.viewer@example.com	Pass@123	Can see and access Dashboard & Reports. The "Create Report" button is hidden, and the corresponding API call would fail.
